# Introduction to Normalization
Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database[clarification needed] in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as an integral part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).

## Dependency 
If attribute A determines the value of B, we write this A -> B â€” meaning that B is functionally dependent on A. In this relationship, A determines the value of B, while B depends on A.

## Full Dependency

## Partial Dependency

## Transitive Dependency
